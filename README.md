Notes for running:

1) The main class is called Runner and is located in the src folder.

2) The class performing most updates is called Background.

Bugs: 

1) Glitchy animation

2) Occasional lock (two opposing actions waiting on each other, no action).

Comments:

1) This was my first project, so I knew not of the evils of hardcoding. Because of this, I could not remove the images and place them into a different file -- most of the image addresses are hardcoded and would require excessive change to shift folders.

2) The Background class takes a role of updating that it was not initially intended for which, though it is functional, produces a less than ideal design.
